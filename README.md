## ðŸš€ Getting Started: Required API Keys

This application requires API keys from Google Cloud to function.

### Step 1: Set Your Environment Variables

In your deployment environment (like Vercel, Netlify, or AI Studio's "Secret keys" panel), you **must set the following variables.** For client-side applications built with Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in your code.

| Variable Name | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key. This is also used for Google Drive API access. | `AIzaSy...` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID. This is required for the "Sync to Google Drive" feature. | `12345...apps.googleusercontent.com` |

**How to get these keys:**
1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Enable the "Gemini API" and "Google Drive API".
3.  Create an `API_KEY` under "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4.  Create an "OAuth 2.0 Client ID" for a "Web application". Make sure to add your app's URL to the "Authorized JavaScript origins". The value you need is the "Client ID".

### Step 2: Run the Application

Once you set the environment variables, the application is ready.

- **Local-First Data:** The app creates a private profile stored in your browser. All data (chats, recordings, settings) is saved locally on your device.
- **Optional Cloud Sync:** You can connect your Google Drive account in the Settings menu. This will create a single, private backup file that only Kwararru can see. This allows your data to be backed up and synced across your different devices. Your data remains in *your* cloud, under your control.
- **Privacy:** Your data does not touch any Kwararru servers.
