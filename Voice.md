# Persona Voice Selection Guide

This document provides guidance on selecting the appropriate prebuilt voice for a new persona. The goal is to match the voice's intrinsic characteristics (pitch, tone, pace) with the persona's intended personality, role, and linguistic traits to create a more immersive and believable experience.

## General Principles

1.  **Match Tone to Role:** A business strategist should sound professional and authoritative (`Orus`, `Charon`), while a therapist should sound calm and empathetic (`Leda`, `Kore`). An energetic character should have an upbeat or bright voice (`Puck`, `Aoede`).
2.  **Consider Gender:** While these are synthesized voices, they are coded with gendered characteristics. Align the voice with the persona's specified gender.
3.  **Uniqueness:** Strive for vocal diversity. Avoid overusing one voice, especially for personas within the same category, to ensure each advisor feels distinct.

## Accent and Language Selection Criteria

The underlying text-to-speech model attempts to apply accents and languages based on system instructions. However, the base voice's fundamental qualities significantly influence the final output's authenticity. Selecting the right base voice is crucial for achieving a believable accent.

*   **For Tonal Languages (e.g., Hausa, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese):**
    *   **Priority:** Pitch stability and clarity. Tonal languages rely on precise pitch contours to convey meaning. A base voice with excessive natural inflection ("excitable," "gravelly") can interfere with the model's ability to render tones accurately.
    *   **Best Voices:** Look for voices described as **"Firm," "Even," "Smooth,"** or **"Clear."** These voices provide a stable, neutral canvas, allowing the AI to superimpose the required tones cleanly. For a **Hausa** speaker, a voice like `Kore` (Firm, Middle pitch) or `Sulafat` (Warm, Even) provides an ideal foundation for its melodic yet distinct tonal patterns.

*   **For Melodic & Pitch-Accent Languages (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Swedish, Indian English):**
    *   **Priority:** Natural musicality and smooth transitions. These languages have a "sing-song" quality or specific pitch drops on certain syllables.
    *   **Best Voices:** Voices described as **"Warm," "Gentle," "Smooth,"** or **"Breezy"** are excellent choices. Their inherent prosody can blend seamlessly with the target language's rhythm. `Aoede` (Breezy) or `Vindemiatrix` (Gentle) would be strong candidates.

*   **For Guttural or Consonant-Heavy Languages (e.g., German, Russian, Arabic, certain UK dialects):**
    *   **Priority:** Resonance and a lower frequency range. This adds weight and authenticity to strong consonant sounds.
    *   **Best Voices:** Look for voices that are **"Deep," "Gravelly," "Resonant,"** or **"Firm."** A lower pitch helps anchor these sounds. `Charon` (Deep, Informative) or `Algenib` (Gravelly, Lower pitch) can provide the necessary gravitas.

*   **For Crisp or Standardized Accents (e.g., Standard American, RP British):**
    *   **Priority:** Clarity and professional pacing. These accents are often associated with broadcasting or formal settings.
    *   **Best Voices:** Voices described as **"Crisp," "Clear," "Professional,"** or **"Informative"** are ideal as they provide a clean, predictable baseline. `Orus` (Crisp, Professional) is a perfect example for a Standard American archetype.
